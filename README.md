# Project: Library [JavaScript]

## Description

This project was done as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)'s [JavaScript course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/javascript). The goal of the project is to produce a simple library app which allows objects to be manipulated in a JavaScript Array. The purpose is to strengthen what was learnt during the original foundation course and provide practise of DOM manipulation.
